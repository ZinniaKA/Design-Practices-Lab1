# Design Practices Lab1
Introductory Lab of the course COP290 : Design Practices under Prof. Abhilash Jindal

## Part 1 : Typing

The faster you type, the faster you code. We do not want to spend any conscious energy on typing. All your conscious energy can be spent on thinking about the code that you are writing.

Students were introduced to [this](https://www.typingstudy.com) where they should practie regularly to eventually reach 60 - 70 words per minute. 

## Part 2 : Editing

You will need to code in a variety of environments such as by logging into a remote server or into an embedded device. GUI-based editors may not be available there. Touching the trackpad/mouse and clicking buttons is very slow.

Students were taught how to use vim.

## Part 3 : Shell Scripting

You can save a lot of time writing one-off programs if you are comfortable with basic shell scripting.

Students were taught how to operate a Linux terminal.

Commands to learn: ls, cd, rm, mv, cp, touch, top, pwd, mkdir, ln, cat,
echo, grep, awk, sed, parallel, cut, sort, uniq, wc, head, less, xargs,
ping, nmap, ssh, find, tree
